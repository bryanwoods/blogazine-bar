This is intended to be a stand alone javascript that creates a nav bar like dustin curtis has for his blogazine.  The idea is to create a logical previous, and next connection between pages much as if you were flipping through a magazine.

Simply include the script:

<script src='blogazine.js' type='text/javascript'></script>

And then use HTML's link elements in the head of your document like so:
<head>
  <link href='/myNextArticleLink' rel='next' title='My Next Article Title' />
  <link href='/myPrevArticleLink' rel='prev' title='My Previous Article Title' />
</head>

Notes:
- Currently does not support IE6/7
- You'll need some sort of reset for html body elements margin.  I suggest the Eric Meyers method included in the demo.css file, but feel free to roll any solution you please.
